The objective behind this project is to identify the locations around which the customers can find the most number of Airbnb listings and predict the price category of Airbnb listings namely affordable, moderate, or expensive using 17 attributes for prediction models, example: if the host is super host, no. of bedrooms, neighborhood, cancellation policy, to name a few.
